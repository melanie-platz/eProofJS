[X] Suggestion for first Step does not work
[] Search for unused Steps in the Solution and store as List in Element id="USEDIDS__QID__"
[X] Authoring ON is not applied on Justifications
[] Randomize Steps creates Error for Suggestions does not work
[] ExportID Does not work 
[] Delete Steps in Authoring Mode with [X] does not work.

FINAL:
[] Remove Debug setting

TUTORIAL:
[] MY-Steps may not have a "_F3" extension as distraktor
[] Install MathJax parallel to eProofJS-Folder.

LOGIC:
[] Wenn Step oder Justification unused mark Step/Just as "FALSE" or "UNUSED"
"FALSE" if ID contains "_F
[] <OUTSTEP class="MARKUSED_SID" id="MARKUNUSED_SID-S3">UNUSED</OUTSTEP> insert in getStepDefHTML()

ERROR:
Add a new conclusion with an ID "MY1_F2" causes an Error in Authoring-Tool:
updateMappedID() for vID=[MY1_F2] failed! MappedID for [MY1] does not exist!
A Mapped-ID for [MY1_F] 2*a+2*b exists.
